# Bash-to-Upload
A Bash Script To Let Users Upload and Download Files Using Command Line 😍

## How To Use
Keep the uploadAll.sh Script in the folder whose files you want to upload, Give it Executable Permissions, Execute it. 😉

## How It Works
It Uploads All the Files of Your Folder to file.io<br>
While uploading it creates another script called download.sh<br>
It Upload the download.sh as well and give user 3 unique commands:<br>
  1) one to download download.sh<br>
  2) another to give executable permission<br>
  3) the lastone to run download.sh<br>

### Download.sh is self Destructive and it will Destruct itself once the Download is Complete. 😝
